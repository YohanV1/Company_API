More than 4,400 men and women representing every state in the U.S. and several foreign countries make up the student body, known as the Brigade of Midshipmen. U.S. News and World Reports has recognized the Naval Academy as a top five undergraduate engineering school and a top 20 best liberal arts college. Midshipmen learn from military and civilian instructors and participate in intercollegiate varsity sports and extracurricular activities. They also study subjects like leadership, ethics, small arms, drill, seamanship and navigation, tactics, naval engineering, weapons, and military law. Upon graduation, midshipmen earn a Bachelor of Science degree in a choice of 25 different subject majors and go on to serve at least five years of exciting and rewarding service as commissioned officers in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps.

The Academy is set on 338 acres between the south bank of the Severn River and historic downtown Annapolis, the state capital of Maryland. Annapolis is 33 miles east of Washington D.C. and 30 miles south of Baltimore.

Midshipmen can choose from a total of 33 intercollegiate varsity sports: 18 for men, 12 for women, and three co-ed. 

Extracurricular activities are offered in areas ranging from engineering societies, military professional clubs and associations, to athletics, music, arts, and other special interests.

The Naval Academy campus is called the Yard, and features tree-lined brick walks, French Renaissance and contemporary architecture, and scenic vistas of the Chesapeake Bay. The Bancroft Hall dormitory complex, the Naval Academy Chapel, and other century-old buildings make the Academy unique.

Volunteerism is a powerful means of engaging people in tackling development challenges, and it can transform the pace and nature of development. Volunteerism benefits both society at large and the individual volunteer by strengthening trust, solidarity, and reciprocity among citizens, and by purposefully creating opportunities for participation. 

UNV contributes to peace and development by advocating for recognition of volunteers, working with partners to integrate volunteerism into development programming, and mobilizing an increasing number and diversity of volunteers, including experienced UN Volunteers, throughout the world. UNV embraces volunteerism as universal and inclusive, and recognizes volunteerism in its diversity as well as the values that sustain it: free will, commitment, engagement and solidarity. 

Based in Bonn, Germany, UNV is active in around 130 countries every year. UNV, with Field Units in 60 countries, is represented worldwide through the offices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and reports to the UNDP Executive Board.
