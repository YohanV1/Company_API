To this end, it provides analysis, policy advice and assistance to governments, it gives focus to the United Nations global mandates in the economic field, in cooperation with other global players and key stakeholders, notably the business community.

The UNECE also sets out norms, standards and conventions to facilitate international cooperation within and outside the region.

The area of expertise of the UNECE covers such sectors as: economic cooperation and integration, energy, environment, housing and land management, gender, population, statistics, timber, trade, and transport.

Made up of 54 member States, and playing a dual role as a regional arm of the UN and as a key component of the African institutional landscape, ECA is well positioned to make unique contributions to address the Continent's development challenges.

ECA's strength derives from its role as the only UN agency mandated to operate at the regional and subregional levels to harness resources and bring them to bear on Africa's priorities. To enhance its impact, ECA places a special focus on collecting up to date and original regional statistics in order to ground its policy research and advocacy on clear objective evidence; promoting policy consensus; providing meaningful capacity development; and providing advisory services in key thematic fields. 

ECA also provides technical advisory services to African governments, intergovernmental organizations and institutions. In addition, it formulates and promotes development assistance programmes and acts as the executing agency for relevant operational projects.

ECA is headed by an  Executive Secretary, who is assisted by two Deputy Executive Secretaries. Its work programme is supported by two pillars: knowledge generation and knowledge delivery. There are five substantive divisions responsible for policy research: Macroeconomic Policy, Regional Integration & Trade, Social Policy Development, Special Initiatives, and the African Centre for Statistics.

The U.S. military defends the homeland, deters adversaries, and builds security around the world by projecting U.S. influence and working with allies and partners. In case deterrence fails, the U.S. military is prepared to fight and win decisively against any adversary.  

Headed by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, the Department is not only in charge of the military, it also employs a topnotch civilian workforce. With more than 1.3 million men and women on active duty, and 742,000 civilian personnel, we are also the nation's largest employer. 

The Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense, is one of the largest office buildings in the world. Built in 1941 by the U.S. Army, the Pentagon has 17.5 miles of corridors yet it takes only seven minutes to walk between any two points in the building. 

Department of Defense personnel are the backbone of America's national security. They represent the diverse makeup of our nation and support not only those on active duty but also families, veterans, and retirees through education, training, and benefit programs. 

Anything you want to do – on land, sea, air, or space -- you can do in service to your nation by joining the Department of Defense. Search for Jobs and Internships at USAJobs.gov.

Shared prosperity, dignified life.
 
Established on 9 August 1973, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is one of five regional commissions of the United Nations, which were created to fulfill the economic and social goals set out in the Charter by promoting cooperation and integration between countries in each region of the world.
 
ESCWA is mandated to support the economic and social development of its 20 member States, promote regional integration, and represent the concerns of those States on the global stage. It analyses socioeconomic conditions, links development knowledge to policy, and advises member States on how best to achieve inclusive and sustainable development.
 
ESCWA brings together policymakers, researchers, experts, and government and intergovernmental bodies to create consensus. On the ground, the Commission provides targeted advisory services to member States.

First convened in 1789, the composition and powers of the Senate are established in Article One of the U.S. Constitution. Each U.S. state is represented by two senators, regardless of population, who serve staggered six-year terms. The chamber of the United States Senate is located in the north wing of the Capitol, in Washington, D.C., the national capital. The House of Representatives convenes in the south wing of the same building.

The Senate has several exclusive powers not granted to the House, including consenting to treaties as a precondition to their ratification and consenting to or confirming appointments of Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, other federal executive officials, military officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, and other federal uniformed officers, as well as trial of federal officials impeached by the House. The Senate is widely considered to be both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives, due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere.
